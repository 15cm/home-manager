This is the current unstable branch and the information in this section is therefore not final.

[[sec-release-23.05-highlights]]
=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* Firefox add-ons are now managed per-profile.
That is, if you are currently having
+
[source,nix]
programs.firefox.extensions = [ foo bar ];
+
in your configuration then you must change it to
+
[source,nix]
programs.firefox.profiles.myprofile.extensions = [ foo bar ];

* The default configuration location has been changed from
`~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix` to `~/.config/home-manager/home.nix`.
+
Similarly, if you are using a Nix flake based setup
then the default flake file location has changed from
`~/.config/nixpkgs/flake.nix` to `~/.config/home-manager/flake.nix`.
+
The old location will continue to work but using it will trigger a warning message.
We changed the default configuration location to avoid confusion about
which files belong to Home Manager and which belong to Nixpkgs.

- <<opt-xsession.windowManager.i3.config.floating.titlebar>>
- <<opt-wayland.windowManager.sway.config.window.titlebar>>
- <<opt-wayland.windowManager.sway.config.floating.titlebar>>

for those options used by `i3` and `sway`.
